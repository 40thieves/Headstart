# Head Start

Head Start presents you with the main areas in the field, and lets you zoom into
the most important publications within each area. It is intended to give
researchers that are new to a field a head start on their literature review
(hence the name).

## Getting Started

### Client
In order to get started quickly, Make sure to have `npm` installed (it comes with Node.js, you can [download installers here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)) and run the following two commands to build the Headstart Client. 

    npm install
    npm run dev

We are using [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to build our client-side application. `webpack` is started in *watch mode* which means that changes to files are tracked and the created `headstart.js` is automatically updated.

Now you can run a local dev server:

	npm start

Point your browser to the following address:

	http://localhost:8080/examples/local_files/index.html

If everything has worked out, you should see the visualization shown above. You will notice, however, that not all of the resources are loaded correctly. To make everything work, you need to edit the file `webpack.config.js`. Find the following line under òutput`:

	publicPath: "http://path/to/dist/",

and change the publicPath to the location of your `dist` folder. In case of the local dev server it should read: 

	publicPath: "http://localhost:8080/dist",

See [client configuration](doc/README.md) for details on adapting the client.

 Also see visualization [options](doc/README.md#visualisation-settings).

### Server

See [Installing and configuring the server](doc/server_config.md) for instructions on how to install and configure the server. Also, see [HOWTO: Get the search repos example to work](doc/howto_search_repos.md).

## Features

* The main areas in the field are represented by the blue bubbles.
* Once you click on a bubble, you are presented with the main papers in that area.
* The dropdown on the right displays the same data in list form. By clicking on one of the papers, you can access all metadata for that paper.
* If a preview is available, you can retrieve it by clicking on the thumbnail in the metadata panel.
* By clicking on the white background, you can then zoom out and inspect another area.
* To access the an overview over time, click on TimeLineView.

The visualization was created with D3.js. It has been successfully tested with Chrome 22, Firefox 15, and Safari 5.1. Unfortunately, Internet Explorer is not supported at this point due to the fact that it is not possible to insert HTML into a foreignObject.

## Showcases

* [Open Knowledge Maps](http://openknowledgemaps.org/): Creates a visualization on the fly based on a user's PLOS search.
* [Overview of Educational Technology](http://openknowledgemaps.org/educational-technology): A working prototype for the field of educational technology. 
* [Conference Navigator 3](http://halley.exp.sis.pitt.edu/cn3/visualization.php?conferenceID=131) [registration required]: An adaptation of Head Start for the conference scheduling system CN3. This version enables users to schedule papers directly from the visualization. Scheduled papers and recommended papers are highlighted.
* [Organic Edunet portal](http://organic-edunet.eu/en/#/recommended): Overview of recommended resources in the Organic Eudnet portal.
